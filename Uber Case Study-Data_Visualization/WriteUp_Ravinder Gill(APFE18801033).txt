Q. What do you think is the reason for this issue for the supply-demand gap? Write the answer in less than 100 words

Ans. There are more number of cancelled trips around 5:00 am to 9:00 am. As drivers are unwilling to travel to airport from city 
due to higher travel time may be because of traffic.

And in evening, at airport there is No cars available from 5:00 pm till 10:00 pm, it can be presumed that drivers do not prefer to wait for the trips in the areas nearby airport. 
In fact they prefer to make short and multiple trips within the city, leading to No cars availability at airport
